# TODO

* Refactor the code so it is far less messy (partly done, could do with
another pass).
* Put readme together for the example
* Get someone to draw me a car...
* Implement resizing based on available viewport resolution
* Implement a reset at the end
* Shift the values into the canvas
* Implement a start and pause option.

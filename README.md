# WDC14 Code examples for Device API

This branch holds the various examples used for my presentation at WDC14 in
Melbourne.

These examples  will permanently reside in branch WDC14 for any future
presentations I might do related to this repo.

If you are looking for touchy feely demos given at WDC12 please look in the WDC12
branch where they are self contained. If you're looking for Device Motion and
Device Orientation demos given at WDC13 please review the WDC13 branch.

To run the examples, clone the repo (or download the files) into a folder. Run
your favourite webserver pointed at the repository.

In Python (will run server on 0.0.0.0:8000):

    cd /path/to/repo/dir
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

In node (will run server on 0.0.0.0:8000)

    cd /path/to/repo/dir
    npm install
    ./app.sh

Then just point your browser at wherever the server is running and you can
play with the examples.

Feel free to hack away on things and if you notice anything worth improving then
all pull requests submitted to https://github.com/ajfisher/wdc will be considered

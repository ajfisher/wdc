# WDC13 Code examples for Device Motion and Device Orientation

This branch holds the various examples used for my presentation at WDC13 in
Melbourne.

These examples  will permanently reside in branch WDC13 for any future
presentations I might do related to this repo.

If you are looking for touchy feely demos given at WDC12 please look in the WDC12
branch where they are self contained.

To run the examples, clone the repo (or download the files) into a folder. Run
your favourite webserver pointed at the repository.

In Python (will run server on 0.0.0.0:8000):

    cd /path/to/repo/dir
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer



In node (will run server on 0.0.0.0:8080)

    npm install http-server -g 
    cd /path/to/repo/dir
    http-server

Then just point your browser at wherever the server is running and you can
play with the examples.

Feel free to hack away on things and if you notice anything worth improving then
all pull requests submitted to https://github.com/ajfisher/wdc will be considered

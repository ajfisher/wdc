Touchy Feely Demo Code
=======================

This is a set of demo code that was created for Web Directions Code in Melbourne in 2012. 

It is licenced using the MIT licence so feel free to use or fork the code as much as you like.

In here there are a range of demos for touch interface behaviour for web applications using the HTML Touch API.

List of files:
---------------

index.html - a straight indicator of touches on the screen on certain elements and basically shows whether touch is working

singletouch.html - a canvas application that detects and plots single touches and all their pertinent information onto a canvas element

multitouch.html - the same canvas application but geared towards multitouch interactions.

pinchzoom.html - showing how to use touch to zoom in or out on an image and some of the boundary checking required to make that work nicely.

touch_type_detection.html - the beginnings of a library being built which looks in a "modernizr" kind of fashion to see what type of touch interactions can be achieved - specifically built to cope with the fact Android doesn't have multitouch in all devices. 

ecom_demo.html - a currently broken example of what an ecommerce application could start to look like.
